My project will be an audio visualizer that will take information about a playing track of music and based on the audio channels it will change the display.  This results in a 2D graph with the x axis specifying each audio channel, and the y axis specifying the intensity of that audio channel.  I would like to add a third element like the visualizer you showed on the first day of class in that each instance would be pushed back and the next instance would be rendered in front of it giving a 3rd dimension of time to the graph.  aesthetically so far I am thinking of having a circular visualizer that would be split into 3 varied colors (most likely RGB) for the 3 different audio channels.  The circle will rotate slightly so the past instances would have more variation.

Week1: Setup program to take an audio track and get its information
Week2: Setup the rendering of an instance of the visualizer
Week3: Setup the pushing of an instance to begin drawing a new instance
Week4: Connect  the audio track information to the visualizer
Week 5: Incorporate options to visually change the visualizer


I will be using THREE.js to create my audio visualizer.
