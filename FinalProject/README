current issues: There is an error that I think might be causing slow down spikes
                  -The error is not causing the spikes, and when I fixed it the program slowed to a halt in a matter of seconds, so for now very unfortunately I am leaving it in...

With this audio visualizer you can upload an audio file (for now I know mp3, mp4, and wav work), it will interpret the audio,
  create spheres, play the audio, and simultaneously modify the transformation of the spheres in tune to the audio.

The original visualizer I heavily based the audio input and conversion on can be found here:https://github.com/wayou/HTML5_Audio_Visualizer
  It is a complete Audio Visualizer using canvas; I used it for it's audio input and conversion, for which it was very helpful!
