Audio visualizer built using three.js

current issues: There is an error that I think might be causing slow down spikes.
                Sphere's need to be fixed, translation ramps up with each sphere.
                Currently does not run in Opera browser.

With this audio visualizer you can upload an audio file (for now I know mp3, mp4, and wav work), it will interpret the audio, 
  create spheres, play the audio, and simultaiously modify the transformation of the spheres in tune to the audio.

The original visualizer I heavily based the audio input and convertion on can be found here:https://github.com/wayou/HTML5_Audio_Visualizer
  It is a complete Audio Visualizer using canvas; I used it for it's audio input and convertion, for which it was very helpful!
