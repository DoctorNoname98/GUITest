Audio visualizer built using three.js

current issues: Fixed error I thought was causing slow down spikes, but spikes persist.


With this audio visualizer you can upload an audio file (for now I know mp3, mp4, and wav work), it will interpret the audio,
  create spheres, play the audio, and simultaneously modify the transformation of the spheres in tune to the audio.

The original visualizer I heavily based the audio input and conversion on can be found here:https://github.com/wayou/HTML5_Audio_Visualizer
  It is a complete Audio Visualizer using canvas; I used it for it's audio input and conversion, for which it was very helpful!
